		<h2>Our favorite competitors</h2>
		<div class="fence push-double--bottom">
			<p>Cursive is perfect if you want to work with a small, highly skilled team to build your website, not a computer or overseas support. We can talk online strategy, social media, and answer your technical questions. We want to build partnerships with businesses and relationships with people. If this doesn't sound right for you, try these companies, where you can build the site yourself and save some money.</p>

				<h3 class="caps">SquareSpace<br>$20/month</h3>
				<p>Great design for users! SquareSpace is our favorite competitor. <strong>The Goods</strong>: Lots of template options, modern, e-commerce. <strong>The Bads</strong>: A bit hard to use if you're making a site.</p>

				<img alt="" width="80" src="img/w.png" class="anchor--center push-double--bottom">
				<h3 class="caps">Weebly<br>$24/month</h3>
				<p>A bit easier to create the site, but less flexible than SquareSpace <strong>Goods</strong>: App to manage your site, e-commerce, good editing interface. <strong>The Bads</strong>: Not as good of design as SquareSpace, less flexible, not as mobile friendly, no free domain.</p>

				<h3 class="caps">Everyone else<br>$/month varies</h3>
				<p>There are a lot of other options, but we don't recommend them. For example, Wix and GoDaddy are very inexpensive, but often don't work on mobile and look awful. Both are  large companies that are more focused on their profits than their customers.</p>
